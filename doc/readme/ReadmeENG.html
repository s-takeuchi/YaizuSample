<h1>1. SERVAL summary</h1>

Due to definition and execution of Windows batch files and Linux shell scripts from remote, flexible monitoring and management of servers and IoT devices can be provided.<br/>
SERVAL provides following features.
<ul>
    <li>Provides management console can be connected from Web browser.</li>
    <li>Manages xaximum 120 servers and IoT devices.</li>
</ul>

Several information systems and application software suites use a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) as a persistence mechanism for their own data. The range of RDBMS usage shows a tendency of expansion.
Most RDBMSs are used as a background service for information systems and application software. However, such systems can also be accessed directly for data mining, quicker commercial operation and maintenance.
An appropriate RDBMS can be chosen to match the characteristics of the target information system and application software. As a result, multiple RDBMSs are often used simultaneously in the same business operation and maintenance environment. However, multiple RDBMS usage is characterized by the following problems:

<ul>
<li>Different data reference software applications need to be provided, which may increase the learning cost.</li>
<li>Data reference software needs to be installed on each client-side PC. The cost of introduction is therefore higher with a greater number of client PCs.</li>
</ul>

CmdFreak is a relational database viewer (data reference software) that provides solutions for the above problems.

<ul>
<li>CmdFreak supports the major free RDBMS MySQL, PostgreSQL and MariaDB systems, providing a common user interface for these RDBMSs and enabling data reference as a common operation. It does not need to learn different reference software applications for multiple RDBMSs, which helps to reduce related learning costs.</li>
<li>CmdFreak works as web application software, and comes with an all-in-one installer incorporating web server software. This eliminates the need for web server pre-configuration and the use of script language. The introduction cost is practically zero.</li>
</ul>

CmdFreak provides the following functions for database reference:

<ul>
<li>List records/paging</li>
<li>Table selection</li>
<li>Table information reference</li>
<li>Column filtering and sorting</li>
<li>DBMS selection</li>
</ul>

<h1>11. About ODBC driver</h1>
CmdFreak uses ODBC for connecting to RDBMS. Therefore ODBC driver needs to be installed into same server where CmdFreak works. ODBC driver needs to be choosen depending on the type of target RDBMS. For example, If you want to use MySQL, ODBC driver for MySQL is required.
CmdFreak works as a 64-bit application hense ODBC driver has to be 64-bit edition of driver. ODBC driver is provided by the vendor who provides RDBMS. Download it from the vendoer Web site.<br/>
